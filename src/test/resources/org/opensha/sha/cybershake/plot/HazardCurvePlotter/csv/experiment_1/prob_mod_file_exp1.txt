#Experiment 1:
#	Only use events which occur on all of the South San Bernardino (SSB), North San Bernardino (NSB), South Mojave (SM) and North Mojave (NM) segments.
#	For these ruptures, place 90% of the probability on the southern 20% of ruptures, by increasing their probability by 350%. The other 80% of ruptures will have their probability decreased by 87.5% to make up the difference.
#Format is:
#source: ruptures (commas, ranges)
#Either 'N', 'C', or 'S' for north, center, south: percentage of hypocenters which fit here
#Increase prob by this much
#Region to decrease probability to make up difference
