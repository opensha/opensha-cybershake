#Experiment 2:
#	Only use events which occur on all of the North San Bernardino (NSB) and South Mojave (SM) segments.
#	For these ruptures, place 90% of the probability on the southern 20% of ruptures, by increasing their probability by 350%. The other 80% of ruptures will have their probability decreased by 87.5% to make up the difference.
#Format is:
